structures: lightweight composite structures adapted to amicus

amicus structures are primarily designed to be the backbones of workflows. So,
the provided subclasses assume that all edges in a composite structure are
unweighted and directed.

Types:
    Adjacency (Type): annotation type for an adjacency list.
    Matrix (Type): annotation type for an adjacency matrix.
    Edge (Type): annotation type for a tuple of edge endpoints.
    Edges (Type): annotation type for an edge list.
    Pipeline (Type): annotation type for a pipeline.
    Pipelines (Type): annotation type for pipelines.
    Nodes (Type): annotation type for one or more nodes.
    
Functions:
    is_adjacency_list (Callable): tests if an object is an adjacency list.
    is_adjacency_matrix (Callable): tests if an object is an adjacency matrix.
    is_edge_list (Callable): tests if an object is an edge list.
    is_pipeline (Callable): tests if an object is a pipeline.
    adjacency_to_edges (Callable): converts adjacency list to edge list.
    adjacency_to_matrix (Callable): converts adjacency list to adjacency matrix.
    edges_to_adjacency (Callable): converts edge list to an adjacency list.
    matrix_to_adjacency (Callable): converts adjacency matrix to an adjacency 
        list.
    pipeline_to_adjacency (Callable): converts pipeline to an adjacency list.

Classes:
    Node (Element, Proxy, collections.abc.Hashable): Wrapper for non-hashable 
        objections that a user wishes to store as nodes. It can be subclassed,
        but a subclass must be a dataclass and call super().__post_init__ to 
        ensure that the hash equivalence methods are added to subclasses.
    Graph (Bunch): a lightweight directed acyclic graph (DAG) that serves as
        the base class for amicus composite structures. Internally, the graph is
        stored as an adjacency list. As a result, it should primarily be used
        for workflows or other uses that do form large graphs. In those
        instances, an adjacency matrix would be far more efficient.

To Do:
    Add an Edge class and seamless support for it in Graph to allow for weights,
        direction, and other edge attributes.

    Graph stores a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as an adjacency list. Despite 
    being called an adjacency "list," the typical and most efficient way to 
    store one is using a python dict. An amicus Graph inherits from a Lexicon 
    in order to allow use of its extra functionality over a plain dict.
    
    Graph supports '+' and '+=' to be used to join two amicus Graph instances. A
    properly formatted adjacency list could also be the added object.
    
    Graph internally supports autovivification where a list is created as a 
    value for a missing key. This means that a Graph need not inherit from 
    defaultdict.

    Graph stores a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as an adjacency list. Despite

    in order to allow use of its extra functionality over a plain dict.
    
    Graph supports '+' and '+=' to be used to join two amicus Graph instances. A
    properly formatted adjacency list could also be the added object.
